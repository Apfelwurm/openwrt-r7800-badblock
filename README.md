Warning: Dont use these images until you know why you want to do this! I am not reponsible for anything that happens to your device with or because this firmwares!

If none of the images work for your case, you can open an issue with your serial output of the boot process and i will try to help you.

If the newest version is not available here, the automatic action might be disabled due to missing activity in this repository. To trigger the build you can simply open a PR with any content and come back later.
